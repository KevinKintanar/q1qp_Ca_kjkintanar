                        To conclude this study, we can now say that being a student leader affects your academic
                        performance in a positive way. As we saw with the GWA data, the student leaders had above
                        average DL qualifying GWAs. Even the lowest GWA which is 1.81 is still pretty high if you
                        compare it to the average GWA of non-student leader students. We can say that the current
                        student leaders of PSHS SMC and ADDU are competent and able to balance their student leader
                        duties and their academic duties.

                        As for possible reasons why, one reason is that when you are a student leader you have to
                        become a role model for your classmates and batchmates. It pushes you to become the best
                        possible version of yourself so that your classmates and batchmates can have a person to look up
                        to. Another reason why is that those who are so called “brave” and confident enough to run for
                        student leader are those who believe in themselves and their skills because they are talented. If
                        you believe in yourself and have the confidence you will put in the required effort to become a
                        good student leader and a good student.

                    <div class="paragraphfont">
                        However, having good grades as a student leader doesn’t mean that being a student leader is
                        easy. It just means that we elected the right leaders for the right job. We elected people who are
                        exceptional, talented, and can skillfully balance being a leader and a student. Being a student
                        leader is still very stressful and of course comes with a lot of responsibilities and duties
                        especially the higher the position you go. There will be moments where being a student leader
                        will make you face the lowest of lows and the most problematic of problems but I assure you
                        (Coming from a Former President) that being a student leader is worth it.

                        Not just because you have power, but also because you can see your classmates, batchmates, and
                        also yourself grow and develop over the school year. Last year, I got to see my classmates and
                        friends in Kamia grow and not only be better students but also be better people and we
                        celebrated that development with our farewell party. Those memories still bring tears to my eyes.
